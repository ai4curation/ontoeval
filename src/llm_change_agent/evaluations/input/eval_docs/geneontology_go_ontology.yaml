- pr28187: "Rationalise 'respiratory chain complex' terms \nFollowing the similar\
    \ efforts to rationalise the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes and TCA\
    \ cycle complexes (see #26122 and #26882), I propose we do something similar for\
    \ respiratory chain complexes.  We currently have separate terms for each of these\
    \ (sub)complexes for eukaryotes (labeled as 'mitochondrial X complex' and sometimes\
    \ also 'chloroplast X complex') and for bacteria (labeled as 'plasma membrane\
    \ X complex'). And then we have orthogonal grouping systems based on the complex\
    \ type or the subcellular location ('X respirasome'). This all results in many\
    \ interconnected terms and an overly complicated tree. These complexes are homologous\

    I think this term should be deleted.

    The given reference (PMID:2519777), which is the same paper pointed to from the
    Wikipedia xref, says: "There are four possible incision sites for AP endonucleases,
    and the enzymes have been classified according to their sites of incision: class
    I and class II AP endonucleases incise 3'' and 5'', respectively, to the AP site,
    both leaving 3''-OH and 5''-P termini; class III and IV enzymes cleave 3'' and
    5'', respectively, to the AP site, generating 3''-P and 5''-OH termini. All known
    class I enzymes are glycosylase-AP endonucleases, and these have been discussed
    above. Most AP endonucleases are of class II. **There is only one known example
    of class III AP endonucleases, the Drosophila AP endonuclease, and no known examples
    of class IV enzymes.**"

    The only known example of class III/IV AP endonuclease referred to is an activity
    described in a single paper from 1986 (PMID:2419327) that has never been reproduced
    or associated with a defined gene/protein (see http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0019639).

    There is only one annotation to the term in QuickGO - S. pombe apn1 (P50525) from

- pr26473: 'Clean-up of GO:0016197 endosomal transport and GO:0098927 vesicle-mediated
    transport between endosomal compartments

    Hi

    I''ve been annotating some proteins involved in endosome maturation and found
    that the associated GO term relations may benefit from a clean-up.

    ![image](https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/assets/143006397/78029b14-5e02-498b-90a6-bed7e6eb23be)

    1. GO:0016197 endosomal transport and GO:0098927 vesicle-mediated transport between
    endosomal compartments seem to be redundant and could possibly be merged or relation
    added GO:0098927 is_a GO:0016197 (This relation seems to have been deleted twice
    but I am unsure of why).

    2. Currently GO:0016197 endosomal transport occurs_in GO:0005622 intracellular
    anatomical structure. This could be refined to occurs_in GO:0005737 cytoplasm.

    3. GO:0016482 cytosolic transport is defined as "The directed movement of substances
    or **organelles** within the cytosol."

    GO:0005829 cytosol is defined as "The part of the cytoplasm that does **not contain
    organelles** but which does contain other particulate matter, such as protein
    complexes."

    GO:0016482 should be renamed cytoplasmic transport and defined as "The directed
    movement of substances or organelles within the cytoplasm." Its relation occurs_in
    GO:005829 cytosol should be changed to occurs_in GO:0005737 cytoplasm.

    4. The two child terms of GO:0098927 (GO:0045022 early endosome to late endosome
    transport and GO:0061502 early endosome to recycling endosome transport) both
    have the relation occurs_in GO:0005829 cytosol. These should be removed as they
    both occur in cytoplasm. occurs_in GO:0005737 cytoplasm would be better but would
    be superfluous if one of their parent terms is already annotated occurs_in GO:0005737
    cytoplasm.

    5. GO:0045022 early endosome to late endosome transport can be given the synonym
    "endosome maturation" (PMID 21878991). The definition may need to be updated to
    reflect that the process is one of vesicle maturation (early endosomes become
    late endsomes acquiring different properties as they traffic deeper into the cell)
    as opposed to vesicles shuttling between two distinct compartments. This could
    be slightly more complicated as multivesicular body formation could also form
    part of endosome maturation.

    This is the first time I am raising an issue like this so please feel free to
    correct me if any of my assumptions are incorrect.'

- pr19486: 'NTR:`acyl-CoA binding`: lack of classification of `acyl-CoA binding` terms,
    general term for rare acyl-CoA derivatives

    We have several existing acyl-CoA binding terms, which don''t classify under a
    CoA related grouping term, even though it seems like they should:

    - acetyl-CoA binding

    - fatty-acyl-CoA binding

    - long-chain fatty acyl-CoA binding

    Looking at ChEBI, it looks like this is the relevant structure, both to solve
    the classification issue and also to answer the quesiton @pgarmiri had about an
    annotation extension specifying "(3S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA":

    -- adenosine 3'',5''-bisphosphate

    --- acyl-CoA

    ---- acetyl-CoA

    ---- fatty acetyl-CoA

    ----- long-chain fatty acetyl-CoA

    ---- omega-carboxyacyl-CoA

    ----- 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA

    ------ (3S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA

    ----- succinyl-CoA

    --- coenzyme A

    Looking at the classification of terms like `acyl-CoA metabolic process` and `acetyl-CoA
    metabolic process`, I think that if I add a term for `acyl-CoA binding` then,
    all three of the terms I listed will automatically classify under the new `acyl-CoA
    binding` term.

- pr18260: "Obsolete 'cell-cell singaling involved in cell-cell junction organization'\n\
    Dear all,\nAs a part of our revisions of the 'cell junction' terms (re point 9\
    \ in https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues/18129), we propose to\
    \ obsolete:\n'cell-cell singaling involved in cell-cell junction organization'\n\
    The reasons for obsoletion are that:\n- the term was created in 2012 and it's\
    \ been used for only 1 NAS annotation (UniProt @pgarmiri); and\n- it can be represented\
    \ as a GO-CAM.\nThere are no mappings to this term and it is not present in any\
    \ subset(s).\nThe GO term entry contains a link to GO Discussions: signalling\n\
    http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Signaling \nWe\u2019d like to proceed and\
    \ obsolete these terms on November 21st, 2019.\nUnless objections are received\
    \ by November 20th, we will assume that you agree to this change.\nThanks,\nBarbara\n\

    1.\tThe 'adherens junction' and 'cell-cell adherens junction' GO terms should\
    \ be merged, because they are intended to represent the same structure. However,\
    \ before doing this, we will need to carry out an annotation review for the 'adherens\

    states it has "granularity above the level of a protein complex". Complexes are
    a bit of a problem as anatomical entities anyway, because (I think) we don''t
    want to have GO-CAMs stating that functions occur in complexes.

    There is currently no term that groups other cellular components to the exclusion
    of protein-containing complex. Could we add a term like ''cellular anatomical
    entity'' as a child of ''cellular_component'', with all cellular components as

    \ of the RecQ helicase/Topo III complex. EMBO J.  24(11):2024-33. PMID:15889139\n\
    Here's a quote:\n> A subset of RecQ family members physically interacts with topoisomerase\
    \ III (Top3) homologues (Gangloff et al, 1994; Goodwin et al, 1999; Johnson et\
    \ al, 2000; Wu et al, 2000). Escherichia coli RecQ stimulates Top3 to catenate\
    \ and decatenate covalently closed duplex DNA (Harmon et al, 1999) and BLM is\
    \ able to stimulate the DNA strand passage activity of Top3\u03B1 (Oakley and\
    \ Hickson, 2002). Furthermore, BLM and Top3\u03B1 can work together to resolve\
    \ a recombination intermediate containing a double Holliday junction (Wu and Hickson,\
    \ 2003). S. cerevisiae strains lacking TOP3 exhibit a severe growth defect, sensitivity\
    \ to DNA\u2010damaging agents, and hyper\u2010recombination (Wallis et al, 1989;\
    \ Gangloff et al, 1994; Chang et al, 2002). Most of the defects exhibited by top3\
    \ mutants can be suppressed by mutation of SGS1 (Gangloff et al, 1994; Chakraverty\
    \ et al, 2001), a relationship that is conserved in Schizosaccharomyces pombe\
    \ where mutations in the recQ homologue rqh1+ can suppress the lethality of top3\u0394\
    \ mutants (Maftahi et al, 1999). These data support models in which RecQ helicase\
    \ action produces a toxic DNA structure that is resolved by Top3 (Gangloff et\
    \ al, 1994; Ira et al, 2003; Wu and Hickson, 2003). \nBased on this quote, this\
    \ term is intended to be a general term for complexes of RecQ family helicases\
    \ with topoisomerase III enzymes. This includes bacterial Topo III as well as\
    \ both mammalian topo III-alpha and topo III-beta, so it is specific for the topoisomerase\
    \ III enzymes, which are within the type IA subfamily, but the term is not broad\
    \ enough to encompass all type IA topoisomerases.\nWith this in mind, I propose\
    \ that we rename this term:\n**Existing name:** RecQ helicase-Topo III complex\n\
    **New name:** RecQ family helicase-topoisomerase III complex\nand make the existing\
    \ term name into an exact synonym.\nI am fine with the existing definition. \n\

    \ because the community generally uses the latter term to refer to the macroautophagy\
    \ of mitochondria.\nThe definition / taxon issue is the use of the word \"vacuole\"\
    \ in the definition of GO:0000422 autophagy of mitochondrion. From the associated\
    \ literature citations, vacuole appears to mean specifically GO:0000324 fungal\
    \ type vacuole, not the generic membrane-bounded intracellular structure found\
    \ in many taxa. Is this taxon constraint - \"only in fungi\" - meant for GO:0000432,\
    \ and if so should it be added to the term with a resulting horrendous legacy\
    \ cleanup of existing annotations to non-fungal proteins?\nAnd if that is not\
    \ what \"vacuole\" is intended to mean in the definition of GO:0000422, then what\
    \ is the intended difference between GO:0000422 and GO:0000423?\nThe answer to\
    \ this question will probably also apply to GO:0030242 autophagy of peroxisome\

    GO:0120113 protein localization by the NVT pathway

    Is a transport pathway and is defined

    A pathway targeting soluble cytosolic proteins to the vacuole lumen. It uses a
    selective autophagy receptor protein Nbr1, which is an ortholog of mammalian NBR1,
    and is remotely related to S. cerevisiae Cvt pathway receptor protein Atg19. Similar
    to the Cvt pathway, the cargos transported by this pathway are hydrolases, which
    presumably contribute to the hydrolytic activities in the vacuole lumen. Different
    from the Cvt pathway, this pathway does not require the macroautophagy machinery,
    but instead relies on the ESCRT machinery for cargo sequestration. This pathway
    is observed in the fission yeast S. pombe. PMID:26365378

    nit sure why the term name is "localization"

    cytoplasm to vacuole transport by the NVT pathway

- pr17250: 'NTR - terms related to GO:0097381 photoreceptor disc membrane

    Mammalian rod cells contain stacks of structures called "membrane discs". There
    is some controversy about how they form that affects conclusions about the spatial
    relationships of components of nascent discs to other rod cell structures and
    the surrounding extracellular space, but once the "membrane disc" is formed there
    appears to be a consensus backed by evidence from several sources that the disc
    is a flattened cytoplasmic vesicle contained within the rod cell cytosol and separate
    from the rod cell plasma membrane. This disc vesicle has three parts distinguishable
    by origin, morphology and protein content: (1) a disc membrane that comprises
    the flattened faces of the disc formed by evagination of the photoreceptor ciliary
    membrane, (2) a disc rim membrane that forms separately from the cilium with a
    distinct content of membrane-associated proteins and that joins the disc membranes,
    and (3) the disc lumen enclosed by this membrane structure (PMID:19582864 for
    a review with clear diagrams; PMID:6771304, PMID: 1730772, and PMID:4100753 for
    experimental evidence).

    Cone cells likewise have discs but they are not fully closed and remain accessible
    to the extracellular space (PMID:19582864).

    Most annotations involving these discs (including ones from Reactome) locate entities
    and activities to the membrane components of discs. However, as part of our own
    work to try to sort out spatial relations among intracellular components we now
    need to locate things with respect to the disc lumen.

    Does it make sense to create a new term GO:new1 photoreceptor disc with definition
    and parentage like that for a cytosolic vesicle, make GO:0097381 photoreceptor
    disc membrane a part_of child of this new term, and give it siblings GO:new2 photoreceptor
    disc rim membrane and GO:new3 photoreceptor disc lumen, again with standard vesicle-part
    definitions and relationships?

    Is a rod cell - cone cell distinction needed, and how would we make it?

    Expert ontology-editorial advice is needed here, and any advice from someone with
    real expertise in the structure and function of mammalian photoreceptor cells
    would be a bonus.

    I can fill in the missing details of term names and definitions once the editorial
    issues are sorted out.'

    This is incorrect.  neurotransmission != hormone secretion and this is the only
    case where the two are tangled in GO right now.  acetylcholine secretion should
    be removed from under hormone secretion.  If acetylcholine acts as a hormone under
    some circumstances, then that should be  represented by a new ''acetylcholine
    hormone secretion'' term.

    This is leading to incorrect classification of neurons as neurosecretory in FBbt
    which is a problem for VFB.

    (More broadly this points to the need for better modelling of roles - the same
    molecule can play the role of a hormone in some situations and the role of a neurotransmitter
    in others), but I wouldn''t want a general fix for this issue to get in the way

    \ to remove this active enzyme see statement in https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/154/1/214/2423434:\
    \ A-II is metabolized in different tissues by various enzymes to generate two\

    \ smaller peptides.\nLooking at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3214724/\
    \ figure 1 I think the confusion has come from the language used eg in Fig 1 legend\
    \ statement: Angiotensin I might also be directly (by neutral endopeptidase) or\
    \ indirectly (by angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin-converting enzyme\
    \ 2 with angiotensin 1\u20139 as intermmediate product) converted to angiotensin\

    \ to angiotensin 1\u20135 while angiotensin II is degraded to angiotensin III\
    \ and IV by aminopeptidase A and M.\nSo they have used the term 'degraded' and\
    \ yet angiotensin III and IV have receptors, and lead to downstream processes.\
    \ I think the term 'in the blood' was included to distinguish these enzymes from\
    \ the final catabolism of angiotensin that probably happens in the cell and may\
    \ occur via non-specific peptidases (I haven't looked into this and as we don't\
    \ have this term I don't think we need to worry about this right now).\nI agree\
    \ that for the three enzymes annotated to the catabolism term a maturation term\
    \ would be better.\nTherefore merge GO:0002003 angiotensin maturation (keep this\
    \ term) with GO:0002005 angiotensin catabolic process in blood (remove this term,\
    \ keep as synonym for GO:0002003 angiotensin maturation). In addition, some of\

    \ points to Aminopeptidase A (APA), the enzyme generating brain AngIII and the\
    \ necessity to create a drug that gets across the blood-brain barrier in order\

    In bacteria, initiation starts when the initiator protein (DnaA; most or all species
    use this gene name) binds to the origin and melts the DNA. DnaA then loads a helicase,
    the helicase melts origin DNA, DNA polymerase and some other proteins come along,
    and Bob''s your uncle. Initiation includes primer synthesis* and ends when DNA
    polymerases start to extend the primers (i.e. when elongation starts).

    *but not the synthesis of Okazaki fragment primers; that''s lagging strand elongation

    For euks, it''s well established that these these steps have to happen:

    \- ORC binds to replication origins;

    \- MCM proteins and a few others, e.g. Cdt1 & Cdc6 (budding yeast names) join
    ORC at origins to form the prereplicative complex (pre-RC);

    \- Yet more proteins (the GINS complex and Cdc45 in fission yeast) join the pre-RC
    to form the DNA replication preinitiation complex (pre-IC) -- a name that may
    or may not be accurate; also, Cdt1 & Cdc6 leave;

    \- Protein phosphorylation happens;

    \- The helicase (MCM hexamer) melts DNA;

    \- DNA polymerases and other proteins join the fun and the first primers are synthesized.

    The exact order of some of the protein phosphorylation events with respect to
    some of the complex assembly events isn''t well established.

    Some sources seem to say that initiation starts with pre-IC assembly (despite
    its name); others count pre-RC formation as an early initiation event; still others
    (tho apparently not many) say DNA melting is the beginning of initiation proper.

    Most, however, are woollier and don''t explicitly peg any of the steps as Step
    1 of Initiation. As a result, the only things I''m really confident of are that
    (a) ORC binding is not the first step -- ORC is bound to origins throughout the
    cell cycle -- and (b) initiation doesn''t start any later than DNA melting.

    I think the end of initiation is basically the same as in bacteria, i.e. primer
    extension/beginning of elongation.

    Sorry for all the parentheticals and weasel words, but I''m having trouble extracting
    anything firmer. There''s a lot of consistency regarding what events happen, and
    to the effect that all of the above events are somehow very relevant to initiation,
    but not about precisely where the line between ''precedes, and required for, initiation''
    and ''part of initiation'' belongs.

    Oh, and just to make it even more complicated, the connections with S phase of
    the cell cycle may have to be evaluated too, because the pre-RC forms during G1.
    So if pre-RC assembly counts as part of initiation, then not all of the entire
    replication process takes place during S phase. Ow my head.

    A specific note: depending on where GO puts the beginning of initiation, the text
    def of GO:0071163 may have to be adjusted.

    have fun,

    Any process that stops, prevents or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of tRNA

    From our recent discussion, should  GO:1900446 (above) warrant  a term ? Unless
    I am mistaken , there is no specific regulator for negatively regulating tRNA
    transcription which is separable from general negative regulation of transcription
    from RNA polymerase III.  Is this a case where you would advise users to capture
    the information in an extension, as it is not a biologically separable process
    ?

    similarly tRNA transcription, is this an process  which can be distinguished from

    Hi,

    apical - GO:0045176 and basolateral- GO:0061467 protein localization terms are
    child of  GO:0008105 - asymmetric protein localization which is correct from my
    point of view. However, protein localization to axon - GO:0099612 is not a child
    of this term while this paper, PubMed=18341993, and many other in the literature
    assume that axon and somatodendritic localization of proteins is the neuronal
    equivalent of apical/basolateral localization of proteins in epithelial cells.
    Could you please create the term somatodendritic protein localization as a child
    of asymetric protein localization and move protein localization to axon as a child
    of this term too.

    Thanks,

- pr14158: 'adapt definition of GO:0007342 so it fits not only mammals

    Fusion of sperm to egg plasma membranes occurs in many taxons, in plants, plasmodium

    GO term for this.

    Would it be possible to simplify the definition of the term "GO:0007342 fusion

- pr14027: 'Proposed obsoletion: single-organism process

    This class was originally created when we thought it would be a good idea to have
    a set of disjoint grouping classes based on granularity at the top of the ontology.

    Increasingly this has become problematic. There are many processes such as ''regulation
    of fluid levels'' which we once assumed single-organism can now turn out to be
    multi-organism (e.g. when a komodo dragon bites its prey, the venom proteins induce
    bleeding hastening death and a meal for the dragon). Many behaviors are susceptible
    to cross-organism regulation.

    I checked with grebe and there are no direct annotations.

    If the term shows up in enrichment analyses, I believe these to be non meaningful.

    Note that we can obsolete this class without immediately obsoleting the full ''single-organism-X''.
    That may come later, but will require more work to transfer annotations.'

    the name of the current term to catabolic autophagy and create a new autophagy
    grouping class. Catabolic autophagy and the Cvt pathway will then become children
    of the new class.'
