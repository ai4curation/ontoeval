- pr2487: '[Class hierarchy] Not all trophobast cells are part of blastocyst

    **CL term**

    [trophoblast cell](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000351)

    **Comments**

    There are extravillous trophoblast cells that invade the decidualized endometrium
    and myometrium or migrate in a retrograde direction along the spiral arteries
    ([PMID:11337369](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11337369)). Therefore, these
    trophoblast cells are not part of the blastocyst and the axiom should be changed.
    The main problem is that these cells are in both fetal and maternal origin structures.

    A possible solution might be to add in Uberon `trophoblast'' SubclassOf ''has
    part'' some ''trophoblast cell''`.

    This cell type differentiates from ''trophectodermal cell''. Therefore, `''develops
    to'' some ''trophectodermal cell''` should be added.

    The definition should also be modifies to reflect trophoblast location and functions.

    **Current definition**

    A cell lining the outside of the blastocyst. After binding to the endometrium,
    trophoblast cells develop into two distinct layers, an inner layer of mononuclear
    cytotrophoblast cells and an outer layer of continuous multinuclear cytoplasm,
    the syncytiotrophoblast cells, which form the early fetal-maternal interface.

    **Proposed definition**

    An extraembryonic cell that develops from a trophectodermal cell and is part of
    the outer layer of the blastocyst and can invade other structures in the uterus
    once the blastocyst implant into the uterine wall. A trophoblast cell is involved
    in the implantation of the embryo into the uterine wall, placental formation,
    remodellation of maternal vasculature in the uterus, nutrient and gas exchange,
    hormone production, and immune modulation to support fetal development.

    membrane by hemidesmosomes and to the adjacent luminal cells by desmosomes. This
    cell type expresses high level of keratin-14 and is estrogen receptor alpha negative.

    **New proposed definition**

    A myoepithelial cell that is part of the mammary gland and is located in the basal
    layer. During lactation, a basal-myoepithelial cell of mammary gland contracts
    under the stimulation of oxytocin. In humans, a basal-myoepithelial cell of mammary
    gland can be identified by high levels of CD49f and low levels of EpCAM.

    Chromatophores in reptiles are typically localized in the dermis, which contrasts
    with mammalian epidermal melanocytes. Few reptile species are reported to also
    possess epidermal melanocytes. Chromatophores or chromatophore-like cells (not

    \ etc\nOverall it looks like there are just too many axes of classification going\
    \ on with insufficient axiomatization to render them complete\nIn some cases it\
    \ seems like CL has grouping classes that are just inherently hard to make complete.\
    \ E.g. my understanding is that role in photopic vision is not discrete. cones\
    \ are typically photopic, rods typically scotopic, but this is not all or nothing\
    \ (if it were, then there would be no need for a distinct \"photopic receptor\

    \ like both photopic and scotopic receptor cells have been there from the early\
    \ days of CL, and they are undefined. These could probably be obsoleted. \nThe\
    \ classification here appears wrong:\n* [] CL:0000210 ! photoreceptor cell\n \

    \ do with light levels. `visible light photoreceptor cell` is also massively incomplete\
    \ - other than photopic, it only has fly neurons.\nI can see a number of challenges\
    \ with making axiomatization complete here related to species specificity. There\
    \ is a lot of tacit information to navigate around; we have the terrible GO-ish\
    \ \"camera-type eye\" which needs to be fixed in GO and Uberon, there is also\
    \ the fact that \"retina\" is used for the vertebrate structure, and the more\
    \ generic photoreceptor array used for adult Drosophila retinal cells. And there\
    \ are the usual annoying exceptions to photoreceptors being found in retinas.\

- pr2147: 'obsolete native cell and animal cell, they are confusing and cause missing
    inferences

    These seem to be used randomly in logical definitions.

    * ''native cell'' is genus in cellHasPlasmaMembranePartX

    * ''cell'' is used as genus in the others

    * ''animal cell'' is never a genus as far as DPs are concerned

    However, animal cell is widely (but not consistently) used as a genus in practice.

    This leads to oddities such as His-purkinje cell not being an animal cell:

    <img width="1136" alt="image" src="https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/assets/50745/35a12365-da38-4502-b190-796f72e75e65">

    (weirdly the inference is added at release time - I assume some property chain
    to taxa is not being imported correctly in the edit file)

    Others that are clearly animal cells are not classified as such:

    <img width="256" alt="image" src="https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/assets/50745/62f1e13f-5c15-472d-ac04-613b492254f4">

    It''s very easy to do this kind of analysis with OAK; here are all cells that
    are not animal cells:

    `cl info .desc//p=i ''cell'' .not .desc//p=i ''animal cell''`

    it''s not too bad - the majority of these are truly generic (and also useless/silly
    groupings but that''s another issue)

    However we are leaving ourselves open to many more missing classifications, this
    is not good

    There are likely a large number of cryptic missing inferences in other ontologies
    when they use CL

    # Proposal 1: Obsolete native cell and animal cell

    These have no purpose other than to confuse. If you want to filter CL by species
    there are better ways.

    Having both is especially confusing and terminologically inconsistent, because
    animal cell is already a native cell. if we care to subdivide at the top level
    why not further down?

    Note I am not proposing we get rid of cancel cell line cell etc. They stay as
    subclasses of ''cell''

    \ RXFP1 has been noted as a highly specific marker gene for the D1/2 cell type.\
    \ The D1/2 cell type has also been described as having characteristics similar\
    \ to a novel medium spiny neuron described in rodents (D1H or eccentric spiny\
    \ projection neuron). Although an extrastriosomal cell type, the D1/2 cell type\
    \ had been noted to express many of the genes associated with striosome, suggesting\

    **Additional notes or concerns**

    I would check that the following terms reason under this new term:

    - mucus secreting cell of bronchus submucosal gland

    - mucus secreting cell of trachea gland

    It would be good to show somehow that this is a tracheobronchial tree. Not sure
    if a link to epithelial cell should be at this level, or if all mucus secreting
    cells, or seromucus secreting cells are epithelial in nature. '

    A cardiac valve cell that lines the surfaces of valve leaflets. Along with valve

    At least in some mammalian species, a valve endothelial cell expresses CD31. Valve
    endothelial cells can undergo an endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to
    acquire a fibroblast or myofibroblast phenotype that leads to changes in the microenvironmental

    CL:1001592 ''gall bladder glandular cell''

    CL:200069 ''gallbladder fibroblast''

    There are no common resources that I found that support the usage of the term
    split into two words, suggesting ''gall bladder'' is a typo.

    As a fix:

    - [x] Update all CL refs:labels to ''gallbladder'' where ''gall bladder'' is present

    - [x] Add ''gall bladder'' as as an exact synonym (gall bladder is a synonym in
    FMA- see below)

    - [x] Add to next CL/UBERON meeting agenda to discuss how to handle historical
    typos such as this. Should a term that includes a typo appear as a synonym?

    - [x] @shawntanzk to fix instances in UBERON https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/pull/2570

    - [x] Create a GO ticket to recommend they update GO terms accordingly

    The following represent the same type of cell:

    The former has incorrect parentage, no definition or synonyms, but has a BTO xref.

    The latter has correct parentage, definition and synonyms.

    Depending on CL preferred procedure, I''d suggest to keep CL:0011107, add synonym
    ''Mueller cell'', and either merge or obsolete CL:0000636. Not sure if you''d

    already exist in CL - e.g. ''appendix goblet cell''. It would be good to keep
    the term label style as consistent as possible across the whole batch so I used
    just ''appendix'' rather than the full ''vermiform appendix'' but do not mind
    either.'

    **Definition (free text, please give PubMed ID in format PMID:XXXXXX)**

    Enterocyte that is a part of vermiform appendix. Enterocytes are columnar cells
    with ditinctive microvilli in the apical surface and they form most of the epithelium
    of the gut intestine. The main function of enterocytes is absorbing molecules
    from the gut lumen and transport them to inner connective tissue and blood vessels.

    layers (with preferences for layers II/III and Va) and a dendritic tree that is
    vertically more restricted than deeper layer VIP cells and extend fewer dendrites
    into the layers outside their home layer (location of soma). L2/3 Bipolar Vip
    Cells have great variability in firing patterns, though most are continuous adapting.
    L2/3 Bipolar Vip Cells are more depolarized in their resting state, had less fast
    rectification, and had smaller after hyperpolarization than deeper Vip cells.

    A Pvalb GABAergic cortical interneuron that is recognizable by the straight terminal

    PV cells are mostly found in upper L2/3, with some in deep L5 of the primary motor

    to basket cells, and have practically absent hyperpolarization sag. Chandelier
    PV cells'' boutons target exclusively the axon initial segment (AIS) of pyramidal
    cells, with a single cell innervating hundreds of pyramidal cells in a clustered
    manner.

    A Lamp5 GABAergic cortical interneuron that has extended axons in the surface
    of L1 of the primary motor cortex. Canopy Lamp5 cells resemble neurogliaform cells
    in having elongated horizontal axonal arbors largely confined to L1; but the dendritic
    arbors are wider and have fewer branches, while the axon is less tortuous and
    extends further from the soma

- pr623: 'Redefine memory T cells in a functional manner

    This is a followup to #110.

    The challenge is as currently defined TEMRA cells (''effector memory CD8-positive,
    alpha-beta T cell, terminally differentiated'' CL:0001062) are not placed by the
    reasoner under the memory T cell hierarchy, as they express CD45RA and not CD45RO.
    As CD45RO is currently used to determine whether a T cell is a memory T cell,
    we should move to a functional differentia instead.

    The suggest fix is to redefine memory T cell (CL:0000813) with the axiom has_completed
    ''memory T cell differentiation'' (GO:0043379) instead of the marker axioms currently
    used.  This functional approach will support non-human species better as well.  Then
    all subtypes of memory T cells will receive the same axiom to allow for proper
    reasoning.'
- pr622: 'Limited revision to B cell hierarchy and class definitions

    Based on discussions with HIPC panel of expert immunologists, the following changes
    are proposed.

    Existing hierarchy

    lymphocyte

    --''lymphocyte of B lineage''

    ----''antibody secreting cell''

    ------''plasma cell''

    -------plasmablast

    ----''B cell''

    ------''immature B cell''

    ------''mature B cell''

    ------''precursor B cell''

    ------''transitional stage B cell''

    Goal 1:  Introduce subclasses of ''lymphocyte of B lineage'' and ''B cell'' that
    bear the mammalian CD19 marker and are taxon restricted.  This will allow annotators
    in non-mammalian species to use the highest level terms for identifiable B cells
    in their respective species without concern about whether a CD19 ortholog is expressed
    in those species.

    New hierarchy

    lymphocyte

    --''lymphocyte of B lineage''

    ----''B cell''

    ----''lymphocyte of B lineage, CD19-positive'' [only_in_taxon some Mammalia]

    ------''B cell, CD19-positive'' [only_in_taxon some Mammalia]

    --------''immature B cell''

    --------''mature B cell''

    --------''precursor B cell''

    --------''transitional stage B cell''

    ----''antibody secreting cell''

    ------''plasma cell''

    -------plasmablast

    Appropriate subsumption and logical definitions will enable inference of a correct
    polyhierachy (not shown above due).

    Textual definitions

    ''lymphocyte of B lineage''

    EXISTING A lymphocyte of B lineage is a lymphocyte that expresses CD19 on the
    cell surface. An additional defining characteristic is the commitment to express
    an immunoglobulin complex.

    NEW A lymphocyte of B lineage with the commitment to express an immunoglobulin
    complex.

    [not sure how to capture this logically for now]

    ''lymphocyte of B lineage, CD19-positive''

    NEW A lymphocyte of B lineage that expresses CD19 on the cell surface. An additional
    defining characteristic is the commitment to express an immunoglobulin complex.

    ''B cell''

    EXISTING A lymphocyte of B lineage with the phenotype CD19-positive, CD20-positive,
    and capable of B cell mediated immunity.

    NEW A lymphocyte of B lineage capable of B cell mediated immunity.

    ''B cell, CD19-positive''

    NEW A lymphocyte of B lineage that is CD19-positive and capable of B cell mediated
    immunity.

    \ proper of large intestine\u2019 should probably be \u2018brush\u2026\u2019.\n\
    - [x] CL:0002265 \u2018type D cell of colon\u2019 has a synonym \u201Ccolonc delta\
    \ cell\u201D, this is probably a typo for \u201Ccolonic\u2026\u201D. \n- [x] The\
    \ label of CL:1000323 \u2018pylroric gastric gland goblet cell\u2019 should be\

    \u201D based on its parentage.\n- [x] CL:0000171 \u2018pancreatic A cell\u2019\
